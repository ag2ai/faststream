    "## What is FastKafka?\n",
    "\n",
    "[FastKafka](https://fastkafka.airt.ai/) is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for building asynchronous services that interact with Kafka topics. Built on top of [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), [AIOKafka](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiokafka) and [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/), FastKafka simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for Kafka topics, handling all the parsing, networking, task scheduling and data generation automatically. With FastKafka, you can quickly prototype and develop high-performance Kafka-based services with minimal code, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to streamline their workflow and accelerate their projects.\n",

    "\n",
    "From [redpanda.com](https://redpanda.com/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Redpanda is a Kafka®-compatible streaming data platform that is proven to be 10x faster and 6x lower in total costs. It is also JVM-free, ZooKeeper®-free, Jepsen-tested and source available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the advantages of Redpanda over Kafka are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A single binary with built-in everything, no ZooKeeper® or JVM needed.\n",
    "2. Costs upto 6X less than Kafka.\n",
    "3. Up to 10x lower average latencies and up to 6x faster Kafka transactions without compromising correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Redpanda, please visit their [website](https://redpanda.com/) or checkout this [blog post](https://redpanda.com/blog/redpanda-vs-kafka-performance-benchmark) comparing Redpanda and Kafka's performance benchmarks."

    "\n",
    "Before writing any code, let’s [create a new virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv) for our project.\n",
