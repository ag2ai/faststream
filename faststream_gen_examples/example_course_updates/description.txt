Develop a FastStream application using localhost broker for testing, staging.example.ai for staging and prod.example.ai for production.
It should consume messages from 'course_updates' topic where the message is a JSON encoded object including two attributes: course_name and new_content. 
If new_content attribute is set, then construct a new message appending 'Updated: ' before the course_name attribute. 
Finally, publish this message to the 'notify_updates' topic. The application should use SASL_SSL with SCRAM-SHA-512 for authentication.
