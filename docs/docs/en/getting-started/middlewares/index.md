# Introduction Middleware

Middlewares in **FastStream** allow you to process messages before and after they are handled by your code.
This allows you to add common functionality to multiple handlers without duplicating code.

Middlewares help keep your business logic separate from the technical aspects of your application.

In this section, you will find a list of available middlewares and detailed information about how they work. You can also learn how to create your own middleware.

## Basic: Middlewares Flow

![flow](../../../assets/img/middlewares-flow.svg){ width=300 height=100 }

It is important to mention the **`parser`**, **`filter`**, **`decoder`** and **`publish`** - they are service functions, FastStream uses them during event processing. More details below:

1. **on_receive** - This method is called first for every incoming message, regardless of whether the message will be processed.
2. [**parser**](../serialization/parser.md){.internal-link} - Converts native broker messages (aiopika, aiokafka, redis, etc.) into FastStream's StreamMessage format
3. [**filter**](../subscription/filtering.md){.internal-link} - Applies filtering logic based on user-defined filter parameters.
4. [**consume_scope**](#important-information-about-consume_scope){.internal-link} - If the filter passes, the flow continues to the handler. otherwise, the event will be passed to another handler. 
    - [**decoder**](../serialization/decoder.md){.internal-link} - Deserializes message bytes into dictionaries or structured data.
    - **Handler** - Executes the message handling function
5. [**publish_scope**](#important-information-about-publishscope){.internal-link} - This method is called for every outgoing message, which includes messages sent via `#!python @publisher` decorators, direct calls to `#!python broker.publish()` or `#!python broker.request()`, and any replies.
    - [**publish**](../publishing/index.md){.internal-link} - The publish_scope calls the publish method, and the result of `consume_scope` will be used as the argument for sending the message.
6. **after_processed** - Final cleanup and post-processing stage.

## 💡 The most common scenario

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="8 18 23"
from types import TracebackType

from faststream import BaseMiddleware


class MyMiddleware(BaseMiddleware):
    async def on_receive(self) -> None:
        # All events are included here, without any other side effects.
        print(f"Received: {self.msg}")
        return await super().on_receive()

    async def after_processed(
        self,
        exc_type: type[BaseException] | None = None,
        exc_val: BaseException | None = None,
        exc_tb: TracebackType | None = None,
    ) -> bool | None:
        if exc_type:  # Catch the error if it occurred in your handler
            ...
        return await super().after_processed(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)


# You can register them to the broker or router scopes.
broker = Broker(middlewares=[MyMiddleware])  # global scope
# Or
router = BrokerRouter(middlewares=[MyMiddleware])  # router scope
```

**Middlewares** can be used Broker scope or [Router](../routers/index.md){.internal-link} scope.

## 🛠️ Full middleware methods

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="8-9 14-15 23-24 32-33"
from types import TracebackType
from typing import Any, Awaitable, Callable

from faststream import BaseMiddleware, PublishCommand, StreamMessage


class MyMiddleware(BaseMiddleware):
    # Use this if you want to add logic when a message is received for the first time,
    # such as logging incoming messages, validating headers, or setting up the context.
    async def on_receive(self) -> Any:
        print(f"Received: {self.msg}")
        return await super().on_receive()

    # Use this if you want to wrap the entire message processing process,
    # such as implementing retry logic, circuit breakers, rate limiting, or authentication.
    async def consume_scope(
        self,
        call_next: Callable[[StreamMessage[Any]], Awaitable[Any]],
        msg: StreamMessage[Any],
    ) -> Any:
        return await call_next(msg)

    # Use this if you want to customize outgoing messages before they are sent,
    # such as adding encryption, compression, or custom headers.
    async def publish_scope(
        self,
        call_next: Callable[[PublishCommand], Awaitable[Any]],
        cmd: PublishCommand,
    ) -> Any:
        return await call_next(cmd)

    # Use this if you want to perform post-processing tasks after message handling has completed,
    # such as cleaning up, logging errors, collecting metrics, or committing transactions.
    async def after_processed(
        self,
        exc_type: type[BaseException] | None = None,
        exc_val: BaseException | None = None,
        exc_tb: TracebackType | None = None,
    ) -> bool | None:
        return await super().after_processed(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)
```

PayAttention to the order: the methods are executed in this sequence after each stage. Read more below in [Middlewares Flow](#basic-middlewares-flow).


### **Important information about `consume_scope`**

The `consume_scope` method is called for each incoming message that passes through the filtering stage, right before the [decoding stage](#basic-middlewares-flow).

Specifically, the `consume_scope` stage is triggered for:

* Messages processed by a decorated handler (`#!python @broker.subscriber(...)`).
* Messages fetched manually using `#!python subscriber.get_one()` or `#!python async for msg in subscriber:`.
* RPC responses received after a `#!python broker.request()` call.

Inside `consume_scope`:

* The `#!python msg: StreamMessage` object is a native **FastStream** object, and its payload is still serialized.
* You can differentiate the origin of the message using `#!python msg.source_type`, which can be:
  * `CONSUME`: For regular subscribers (points 1 and 2 above).
  * `RESPONSE`: For RPC responses (point 3 above).

### **Important information about `publish_scope`**

If you want to intercept the publishing process, you will need to use the **publish_scope** method. This method consumes the message body and any other options passed to the `publish` method (such as destination headers, etc.). So, you can patch them any kind you want.

**publish_scope** affect all ways of publishing something, including the `#!python broker.publish(...)` call and reply-to / RPC replies.

To differentiate between different types of publishers, you can use `cmd.publish_type`. It can be one of the following `Enum`:

* `PUBLISH`: Regular `#!python broker/publisher.publish(...)` call.
* `REPLY`: Response to RPC/Reply-To request.
* `REQUEST`: RPC request call.


!!! tip "Batch Publishing"

    When you publish multiple messages at once using the `#!python broker.publish_batch(...)` method, the `publish_scope` receives a `BatchPublishCommand` object. This object holds all the messages to be sent in its `cmd.batch_bodies` attribute. This feature is useful for intercepting and modifying the batch publication process.

✨ If the basic PublishCommand does not meet your needs, you can use the extended option. Here is an example:

=== "Default"
    ```python linenums="1"
    from typing import Any, Awaitable, Callable

    from faststream import BaseMiddleware, PublishCommand


    class DefaultPublishMiddleware(BaseMiddleware):
        async def publish_scope(
            self,
            call_next: Callable[[PublishCommand], Awaitable[Any]],
            cmd: PublishCommand,
        ) -> Any:
            return await call_next(cmd)
    ```

=== "Batch"
    ```python linenums="1"
    from typing import Any, Awaitable, Callable

    from faststream import BaseMiddleware, BatchPublishCommand


    class BatchPublishMiddleware(BaseMiddleware[BatchPublishCommand]):
        async def publish_scope(
            self,
            call_next: Callable[[BatchPublishCommand], Awaitable[Any]],
            cmd: BatchPublishCommand,
        ) -> Any:
            # you can access `cmd.batch_bodies` here
            return await call_next(cmd)
    ```

=== "AIOKafka"
    ```python linenums="1"
    from typing import Any, Awaitable, Callable

    from faststream import BaseMiddleware
    from faststream.kafka import KafkaPublishCommand


    class KafkaPublishMiddleware(BaseMiddleware[KafkaPublishCommand]):
        async def publish_scope(
            self,
            call_next: Callable[[KafkaPublishCommand], Awaitable[Any]],
            cmd: KafkaPublishCommand,
        ) -> Any:
            return await call_next(cmd)
    ```

=== "Confluent"
    ```python linenums="1"
    from typing import Any, Awaitable, Callable

    from faststream import BaseMiddleware
    from faststream.confluent import KafkaPublishCommand


    class KafkaPublishMiddleware(BaseMiddleware[KafkaPublishCommand]):
        async def publish_scope(
            self,
            call_next: Callable[[KafkaPublishCommand], Awaitable[Any]],
            cmd: KafkaPublishCommand,
        ) -> Any:
            return await call_next(cmd)
    ```

=== "RabbitMQ"
    ```python linenums="1"
    from typing import Any, Awaitable, Callable

    from faststream import BaseMiddleware
    from faststream.rabbit import RabbitPublishCommand


    class RabbitPublishMiddleware(BaseMiddleware[RabbitPublishCommand]):
        async def publish_scope(
            self,
            call_next: Callable[[RabbitPublishCommand], Awaitable[Any]],
            cmd: RabbitPublishCommand,
        ) -> Any:
            return await call_next(cmd)
    ```

=== "NATS"
    ```python linenums="1"
    from typing import Any, Awaitable, Callable

    from faststream import BaseMiddleware
    from faststream.nats import NatsPublishCommand


    class NatsPublishMiddleware(BaseMiddleware[NatsPublishCommand]):
        async def publish_scope(
            self,
            call_next: Callable[[NatsPublishCommand], Awaitable[Any]],
            cmd: NatsPublishCommand,
        ) -> Any:
            return await call_next(cmd)
    ```

=== "Redis"
    ```python linenums="1"
    from typing import Any, Awaitable, Callable

    from faststream import BaseMiddleware
    from faststream.redis import RedisPublishCommand


    class RedisPublishMiddleware(BaseMiddleware[RedisPublishCommand]):
        async def publish_scope(
            self,
            call_next: Callable[[RedisPublishCommand], Awaitable[Any]],
            cmd: RedisPublishCommand,
        ) -> Any:
            return await call_next(cmd)
    ```

## 📦 Context Access

Middlewares can access the [Context](../context/){.internal-link} for all available methods. For example:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="13"
from collections.abc import Awaitable, Callable
from typing import Any

from faststream import BaseMiddleware, StreamMessage


class ContextMiddleware(BaseMiddleware):
    async def consume_scope(
        self,
        call_next: Callable[[StreamMessage[Any]], Awaitable[Any]],
        msg: StreamMessage[Any],
    ) -> Any:
        message_context = self.context.get_local("message")
        return await call_next(msg)
```

## 🚀 Real examples

### 🔁 Retry Middleware

```python linenums="1"
import asyncio
from collections.abc import Awaitable, Callable
from typing import Any, Final

from typing_extensions import override

from faststream import BaseMiddleware, FastStream, Logger, StreamMessage
from faststream.redis import RedisBroker


class RetryMiddleware(BaseMiddleware):
    MAX_RETRIES: Final[int] = 3

    @override
    async def consume_scope(
        self,
        call_next: Callable[[StreamMessage[Any]], Awaitable[Any]],
        msg: StreamMessage[Any],
    ) -> Any:
        logger: Logger = self.context.get_local("logger")
        for attempt in range(self.MAX_RETRIES + 1):
            try:
                return await call_next(msg)
            except Exception:
                if attempt == self.MAX_RETRIES:
                    logger.exception("Failed after %s retries.", self.MAX_RETRIES)
                    raise

                logger.exception("Attempt %s failed, retrying...", attempt + 1)
                await asyncio.sleep(2**attempt)  # Exponential backoff
        return None


broker = RedisBroker(middlewares=[RetryMiddleware])
app = FastStream(broker)
```

## 📝 Summary

Middlewares in **FastStream** offer a powerful mechanism to hook into the message processing lifecycle. Key points to remember:

1. [**Order of execution matters**](#basic-middlewares-flow){.internal-link} - Methods are called in a specific sequence: `on_receive` → parser → filter → `consume_scope` → decoder → handler → `publish_scope` → publish → `after_processed`.
2. **Comprehensive Publishing Hook**: The `publish_scope` method intercepts all outgoing messages, regardless of whether they are from a `#!python @publisher` decorator, a direct `#!python broker.publish()` or `#!python publisher.publish()` call, or an RPC `#!python broker.request()`.
3. **Chain of Responsibility**: In order to ensure that the message continues through the processing pipeline, your middleware must call the next component in the chain. This is typically done by calling the `call_next()` method with the message or command as an argument, or by using the `super()` function to call the implementation of the next method in the chain.
4. [**Context Access**](../context/){.internal-link}: All middleware methods have access to the FastStream context via `#!python self.context`.
5. [**Broker-specific extensions**](#if-the-basic-publishcommand-does-not-meet-your-needs-you-can-use-the-extended-option-here-is-an-example){.internal-link}: If the basic publish command does not meet your needs, you can use the extended option. Here is an example: Use typed publish commands (`KafkaPublishCommand` and `RabbitPublishCommand`) to access and manipulate broker-specific attributes when publishing messages.

To choose the right method for your needs, think about the stage you want to intervene in: **on_receive** for the initial message arrival, **consume_scope** to wrap the core processing logic, **publish_scope** for outgoing messages, and **after_processed** for post-processing and cleanup.
