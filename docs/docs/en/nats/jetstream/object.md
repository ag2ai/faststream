# Object Storage

Object storage is almost identical to the [*Key-Value*](./key-value.md) stroge concept, so you can reuse the guide.

## Overview

[*Object Storage*](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream/obj_store){.external-link target="_blank"} is just a high-level interface on top of *NatsJS*.

It is a regular *JetStream*, where the *Object key* is a subject.

The main difference between *KV* and *Object* storages is that in the *Object* storage, you can store files greater than **1MB** (a limitation of *KV*). It has no limit on the maximum object size and stores it in chunks (each message is an object chunk), so you can literally *stream* huge objects through *NATS*.

## FastStream Details

**FastStream** has no native interfaces to this *NatsJS* functionality (yet), but it allows you to access the inner `JetStream` object to create in manually.

First of all, you need to create an *Object* storage object and pass in to the context:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="14-15"
{!> docs_src/nats/js/object.py [ln:7-9,13-14,24-29] !}
```

!!! tip
    We placed this code in the `#!python @app.on_startup` hook because `#!python @app.after_startup` will be triggered **AFTER** your handlers start consuming messages. So, if you need to have access to any custom context objects, you should set them up in the `#!python @app.on_startup` hook.

    Also, we call `#!python await broker.connect()` method manually to establish the connection to be able to create a storage.

---

Next, we are ready to use this object right in the our handlers.

Let's create an Annotated object to shorten `Context` object access:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="5"
{!> docs_src/nats/js/object.py [ln:3-4,11] !}
```

And just use it in a handler:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="8 10-11"
{!> docs_src/nats/js/object.py [ln:1,6,17-21] !}
```

Finally, let's test our code behavior by putting something into the *Object storage* and sending a message:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="3-4"
{!> docs_src/nats/js/object.py [ln:32-35] !}
```

!!! tip
    [`BytesIO`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#binary-i-o){.external-link target="_blank"} - is a *Readable* object used to emulate a file opened for reading.

??? example "Full listing"
    ```python linenums="1"
    {!> docs_src/nats/js/object.py !}
    ```
