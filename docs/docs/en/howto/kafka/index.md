# How To

**Kafka** is a really complex tool, so **FastStream** `KafkaBroker` API can be complecated and confusing in specific cases. Our main documentation sections covers only the main **FastStream** and **Kafka** concepts though. Thus, this section should provides you with concrete **FastStream - Kafka** examples you can use in your regular services as copy-past code or reference at least.

We (**airt** team) hope, that this section will be maintained by the community. Please, feel free add any examples/sections or edit existed ones. If you didn't find the solution in the docs yet - this is a great point to add a new article here!

To add a new page to this section, just add a new **Markdown** file to [`docs/docs/en/howto/kafka`](https://github.com/airtai/faststream/tree/main/docs/docs/en/howto/kafka){.external-link target="_blank"} directory and to the [`navigation_template.txt`](https://github.com/airtai/faststream/blob/main/docs/docs/navigation_template.txt){.external-link target="_blank"} file.
