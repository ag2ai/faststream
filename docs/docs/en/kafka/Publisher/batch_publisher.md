# Publishing in batches

If you want to send your data in batches `#!python @broker.publisher(...)` decorator makes that possible for you.
To produce in batches you need to do two things:

1. When creating your publisher, set the `batch` argument to `True`
2. Return a tuple of the messages you wish to send in a batch. This action will prompt the producer to collect the messages and send them in a batch to a Kafka broker.

Here is an example of an app producing in batches to **output_data** topic when consuming from **input_data_1**.

In the highligted lines, we can see the steps of creating and using a batch publisher:

1. Creation of publisher
2. Publishing an actual batch of messages
