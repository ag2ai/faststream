# FastStream People

FastStream has an amazing community that welcomes people from all backgrounds.

## Team

This is the current list of team members. ðŸ˜Ž

They have different levels of involvement and permissions, they can perform [repository management tasks](./management-tasks.md){.internal-link target=_blank} and together we  [manage the FastStream repository](./management.md){.internal-link target=_blank}.

Although the team members have the permissions to perform privileged tasks, all the [help from others maintaining FastStream](./help-fastapi.md#help-maintain-fastapi){.internal-link target=_blank} is very much appreciated!
