Making streaming microservices has never been easier. Designed with junior developers in mind, FastStream simplifies your work while keeping the door open for more advanced use-cases. Here's a look at the core features that make FastStream a go-to framework for modern, data-centric microservices.

- **Multiple Brokers Support**: Switching between Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ? No problem. FastStream provides a unified API to work across multiple message brokers.

- **Pydantic Validation**: Leverage Pydantic's powerful validation capabilities to ensure your data models are always correct. Both annotation-based and model-based validations are supported.

- **Automatic Docs**: Stay ahead with automatic [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/){.external-link target="_blank"} documentation. No need to manually keep your API docs up to date.

- **Powerful Dependency Injection System**: Manage your service dependencies efficiently with FastStream's built-in DI system. It's so easy to use, even for junior developers.

- **Testable**: Writing unit tests has never been this simple. FastStream's architecture supports in-memory tests, making your CI/CD pipeline faster and more reliable.

- **Extendable**: Need custom serialization or middlewares? FastStream supports extensions for lifespans, custom serialization methods, and even middlewares.

- **Built for Automatic Code Generation**: Cut down development time and improve reliability. With its high-level abstractions and well-designed architecture, FastStream is optimized for automatic code generation using advanced models like GPT and Llama.

That's FastStream in a nutshellâ€”easy, efficient, and powerful. Whether you're just starting with streaming microservices or looking to scale, FastStream has got you covered.
