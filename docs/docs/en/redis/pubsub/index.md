# Redis Channels

Redis channels are a feature of Redis that enables messaging between clients through a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) pattern. A Redis channel is essentially a medium through which messages are transmitted. Different clients can subscribe to these channels to listen for messages, while other clients can publish messages to these channels.

When a message is published to a Redis channel, all subscribers to that channel receive the message instantly. This makes Redis channels suitable for a variety of real-time applications such as chat rooms, notifications, live updates, and many more use cases where messages must be broadcast promptly to multiple clients.
