# Redis Lists

Redis Lists are a simple and flexible data structure that function as ordered collections of strings. They are similar to lists in programming languages, and Redis provides commands to perform a variety of operations such as adding, retrieving, and removing elements from either end of the list.

Redis Lists are particularly useful for scenarios such as implementing queues, effectively using the list as a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) structure.
