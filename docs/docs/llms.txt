# FastStream
> Open-source framework for building asynchronous web services that interact with event streams.Supports Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, Redis, and integrates seamlessly with FastAPI.

FastStream simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for message queues, handling all the parsing, networking and documentation generation automatically.
Making streaming microservices has never been easier. Designed with junior developers in mind, FastStream simplifies your work while keeping the door open for more advanced use cases.
